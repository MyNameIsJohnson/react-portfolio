      "I love problem solving and am a lifelong learner. I am always looking for new ways to solve problems more efficiently in order to optimize my code. When I use products, I tend to look for things that could be implemented to make the user experience better and transfer that knowledge to my projects. I know when to research tools or libraries to use for certain designs and features of my projects, which keeps me up to date with new technology. Having worked on teams of developers, and owning different features, I can stay on track with any of my projects codebase.",
